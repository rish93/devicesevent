/// 404 with controller as response body was not defined, hence rest controller
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/duecreate/v1.0")
public class DueCreateController {

}
Response:

{
"timestamp": 1529692263422,
"status": 404,
"error": "Not Found",
"message": "No message available",
"path": "/duecreate/v1.0/status"
}
after changing it to below code I received proper response

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/duecreate/v1.0")
public class DueCreateController {

}
Response:

{
"batchId": "DUE1529673844630",
"batchType": null,
"executionDate": null,
"status": "OPEN"
}
